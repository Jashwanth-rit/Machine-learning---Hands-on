# Machine Learning Project on Flower Classification üå∏

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple **machine learning model** to classify different types of flowers based on various features like petal length, petal width, etc. The project uses the **Linear Regression** algorithm along with libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib** for data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.

---

## Key Components
### 1. **Linear Regression Model**
   - Implemented a **Linear Regression** model to predict and classify flowers based on input features.
   - The model was trained and evaluated using a well-known flower dataset.
   
### 2. **Pandas** üêº
   - Used **Pandas** for data handling and manipulation, including loading, cleaning, and preprocessing the dataset.
   - Grouping and organizing data to extract insights and prepare it for model training.

### 3. **NumPy** üî¢
   - Utilized **NumPy** for efficient numerical computations, especially while handling arrays and performing matrix operations during the model's development.

### 4. **Matplotlib** üìä
   - Visualized the relationships between features using **Matplotlib**.
   - Plotted graphs like scatter plots, histograms, and line plots to better understand the data distribution and the model's performance.
