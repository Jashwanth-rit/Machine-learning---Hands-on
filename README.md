# Machine Learning Project Repository

This repository contains various projects and implementations related to data science and machine learning, focusing on essential Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. The main project involves building a **Linear Regression** model along with other machine learning tasks.

## Topics Covered

1. **Pandas**: 
   - Data manipulation and cleaning.
   - Working with DataFrames, reading, and processing datasets.

2. **NumPy**: 
   - Numerical computing.
   - Array operations, linear algebra, and mathematical computations.

3. **Matplotlib**: 
   - Data visualization and plotting graphs.
   - Customizing charts, and plotting results from machine learning models.

4. **Linear Regression**:
   - Implemented a Linear Regression model from scratch using NumPy and Scikit-learn.
   - Visualized the model's performance using Matplotlib.

5. **Machine Learning Models**:
   - Built and trained machine learning models using libraries like Scikit-learn.
   - Explored various techniques for model evaluation and accuracy testing.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter notebooks or Python scripts to explore the models and code.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas** for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy** for numerical computing.
- **Matplotlib** for visualizations and plotting.
- **Scikit-learn** for implementing machine learning models like Linear Regression.

## Visualizations

This project includes various visualizations such as:
- Scatter plots
- Line charts for regression results
- Histograms and bar plots for data analysis

## Future Work

In future updates, I plan to:
- Expand into other machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Neural Networks.
- Improve the accuracy and performance of the models.
- Add more complex data preprocessing techniques.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or raise issues!
